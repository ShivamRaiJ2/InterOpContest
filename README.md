# InterOpContest

## Overview
InterOpContest is a comprehensive project designed to facilitate interoperability between various healthcare data standards and formats. The project provides tools and services for converting, processing, and visualizing healthcare data, ensuring seamless integration and communication between different systems.

## Key Features
- **FHIR to CCDA Conversion**: Tools to convert FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data to CCDA (Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture) format.
- **CCDA to HTML Rendering**: Generate human-readable HTML views from CCDA documents.
- **SDA Transformations**: Support for transforming healthcare data using SDA (Structured Data Architecture) standards.
- **XSLT Stylesheets**: A collection of XSLT files for various data transformations, including FHIR, CCDA, and SDA.
- **RESTful APIs**: Expose functionality through REST APIs for easy integration with external systems.
- **UI Components**: User interfaces for visualizing and interacting with healthcare data.

## Project Structure
- **src/Custom/**: Contains the core logic for data processing, including operations, requests, responses, and services.
  - **FHIR/**: Modules related to FHIR data handling.
  - **Operation/**: Logic for processing and transforming data.
  - **Process/**: Classes for converting between formats like FHIR to SDA and SDA to CCDA.
  - **Request/**: Classes for handling incoming requests.
  - **Response/**: Classes for generating responses.
  - **Service/**: Services for receiving and processing data.
  - **UI/**: User interface components, such as the FHIR to CCDA viewer.
- **iris25comm/**: Contains XSLT stylesheets and other resources for data transformation.
  - **FHIR/**: Stylesheets for formatting FHIR data.
  - **SDA3/**: Stylesheets for SDA transformations.
  - **IHE/**: Stylesheets for IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) profiles.
